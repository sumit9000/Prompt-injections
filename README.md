# Prompt-injections
Prompt injection is a type of attack where malicious users craft prompts that trick or manipulate a language model into:
- Ignoring system-level or developer instructions
- Producing harmful, biased, or manipulated content
- Bypassing safety mechanisms or revealing hidden data

## 🧠 Why Does This Matter?

As LLMs are increasingly embedded in chatbots, search, writing assistants, and decision-making tools, prompt injection threatens:

- 🔓 User privacy
- 🧨 Model safety
- 📉 Trustworthiness of responses
- 💸 Commercial fairness (e.g., biased recommendations)

## 🛡️ Mitigating Prompt Injection

While this document introduces the basics of prompt injection, defending against it requires:

- Prompt sanitization
- Clear separation between system and user inputs
- Use of classifiers like **Prompt Guard**
- Fine-tuned moderation models like **LLaMA Guard**
